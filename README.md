lookshelf
=============================

Lookshelf is a website that allows its users to upload images of their personal, 
private bookshelf collections so that they may show them to other users of the site 
to give them the option to request to borrow the books they want. It helps people to 
gain subject matter in the areas of their interest or read the books that they love
but do not own so that they do not need to bother with purchasing an expensive book 
at the bookstore or need to check-out a book at the local library.  

The application is written in the Meteor JS application framework (meteor.com).
